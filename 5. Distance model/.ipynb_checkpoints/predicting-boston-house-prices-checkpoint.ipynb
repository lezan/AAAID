    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: ** In my opinion, the value of 'MEDV' will be dependent on these 3 features in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **RM** - The more the value of RM, the more will be the value of 'MEDV'. Because it's pretty evident that with increase in the number of rooms, the price of the house will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **LSTAT** - The more the value of LSTAT, the less will be the value of 'MEDV'. Because with increase in the percentage of \"lower class\" homeowners in the neighbourhood, the crime rate in the neighbourhood may increase. Even though LSTAT doesn't have a causal effect on the crime rate in the neighbourhood, they are likely to be positively correlated. One more factor is if there are greater percentages of \"lower class\" homeowners in the neighbourhood, then more likely very expensive real estate owners will not build their housing complexes in that region as most of the people will not be able to afford it. So in average, the houses in that region will be cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **PTRATIO** - The lesser the value of PTRATIO, the more will be the value of 'MEDV'. Because if the students to teacher ratio is low, then that means individual students gets much more attention from the students as opposed to a region where this ratio is high. Over there, as the number of students will be much higher than the number of teachers, teachers will not be able to attend to students individually everytime and hence this may affect the education of the students. So regions with a low PTRATIO will have higher prices for houses."

Here there is a very high chance of getting a high variance model which may eventually lead to a 100% accuracy rate with addition of new features, but that's only because it is overfitting the data. It has developed such a complex model that it will have limited or no ability to generalize data and so when we use that model on unknown data, it will give us very very low accuracy. So to avoid that, we can split the data into training and testing sets and train the model on the training data. Then the testing accuracy is a much better estimate than the training accuracy. \n",

    "But then, the split might create a problem too. If we have a very limited dataset, then even if we take out a small sample of it as testing data, then also , we are losing a portion of the data. So there's an inherent trade off here which might cause underfitting due to limited datasets. This is where we can take advantage of K-fold cross validation where we divide all the datapoints into k number of bins and then run k separate learning experiments. In each of those, we pick one of those k subsets as our testing set and the remaining k-1 bins as our training sets. This is how we can maximize the machine's learning experiment."

    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) max_depth = 1 (High Bias Scenario):  We see that initially the Testing Score(green line)  increases with increase in number of training points. But then it plateaus at a very low accuracy score of 0.4 or 40% and increase in number of training points have no effect. This shows that the model does not generalize well on unseen data. On the other hand, the Training Score(red line)  decreases with increase in the number of training points and gets saturated at a score of approximately 0.4 or 40%. This shows that the model is actually underfitting the data and is not complex enough. In this scenario, adding more training points will not benefit the model. Instead, its complexity should be increased for better fitting the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "B)max_depth = 3 (Best scenario): Testing Score(green line) increases with increase in training points. It reaches a pretty high score of 0.8 and so we can see the model generalizes well. The Training Score(red line) decreases slightly and reaches 0.8 and stays constant. So we see it fits the model well and reaches a pretty high score. The testing score has two significant phases where the rates of change are different. One is the positive rate of change which goes on uptil approximately 200 training points (within this positive rate of change, we again observe two different rates. One is uptil 50 training points where the rate of increase is very high.The other is between 50 - 200 where the rate of increase is much lower.) and the other is the region where it plateaus with no/very little rate of change which is beyond 200 training points. So if we are below 200 training points, adding more training points will definitely improve the score but beyond that adding more training points will not be very useful as the rate plateaus.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) max_depth = 6 (High Variance Scenario): Testing Score(green line) increases with increase in training points and reaches 0.7. Even though this is not a bad accuracy, it is not generalizing the data as well as max_depth = 3. The Training Score(red line) decrease ever so slightly and stays at 0.9 which is a big sign that it is overfitting the data. It is a High Variance problem. Here also, the testing score show a similar behaviour as the previous one (it plateaus after 200 training points). So once again, we will get an improvement in the testing score by adding more training points when the nuber of training points is less than 200, but after that adding more training points will not benefit us much.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) max_depth = 10 (Higher Variance Scenario): Testing Score(green line) increases with increase in training points and reaches 0.7. So same problem as the previous one. It is not generalizing the data as well as scenario B). The  Training Score(red line) remains constant throughout showing a perfect accuracy of 100% or a score of 1 which tells us it is definitely overfitting the data. This is also a very High Variance problem. Once again the curve show exactly the same behaviour where adding more training points upto 200 will increase the score but not beyond that.\n",

    "**Answer: ** In K-fold cross validation technique, we partition the data into k-bins of equal size. After that we run k separate learning experiments. In each of those, we pick one of the k subsets as our testing set. The remaining k-1 bins are put together into the training set. Then we train our machine learning algorithm and just like before test the performance on the testing set. The key thing in cross validation is we run this multiple times (k times) and then we average the k different testing set performances for the k different hold out sets. So we average the test results from those k experiments. So obviously this takes more computation time as now we have to run k separate learning experiments, but the assessment of the learning algorithm will be more accurate.\n",

To ensure that we are producing an optimized model, we will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While we're working on our implementation, we'll think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
